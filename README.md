# Liver Patient Prediction 🏥🔬

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has liver disease based on medical data using **Machine Learning** techniques. It utilizes patient health indicators such as **bilirubin levels, albumin, enzymes, and age** to build a predictive model.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to assist in the early detection of liver disease by analyzing relevant medical attributes. The key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Data normalization by calculating skewness of features
- Training and evaluating machine learning models
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

## 🚀 Features
✅ Utilizes a real liver patient dataset for analysis  
✅ Implements multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
✅ Provides statistical insights into liver disease risk factors  
✅ Optimized for high prediction accuracy  
✅ Visualizes key health indicators affecting liver disease  
✅ Applies data normalization techniques to improve model performance  
✅ Includes hyperparameter tuning for enhanced predictive power  

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
To enhance the performance of the model, hyperparameter tuning was applied. Key techniques include:
- **Data Normalization:** Addressed feature skewness to improve model convergence.
- **Grid Search & Randomized Search:** Identified optimal hyperparameters for different models.
- **Cross-validation:** Ensured model generalization and avoided overfitting.
